# XBount — Decentralized Bounty Platform with AI Assistance

**XBount** is a decentralized platform where users can post bounties, solve challenges to earn rewards, and receive AI-powered assistance. The entire payment system is built using the **x402 protocol** and **Coinbase CDP Wallet API**, enabling secure, trustless, and onchain microtransactions.

## Key Features

### 1. Bounty Posting
Users can post challenges with a specified title, description, and reward (e.g. USDC). To make the bounty active, the creator must transfer the reward amount to the platform wallet using a CDP wallet-powered x402 payment flow.

### 2. Solving Challenges
Other users can submit solutions to posted bounties. To submit a solution, a solver must pay a small fee (e.g., 0.01 USDC). This encourages high-quality answers and discourages spam. Once a bounty creator selects a solution, the prize is automatically transferred to the selected solver’s wallet.

### 3. AI Assistance (Ask AI)
XBount features multiple domain-specific AI Assistants trained on curated datasets (e.g., for coding, legal advice, or research). Users can submit queries to these AI agents by paying a small per-query fee (e.g., 0.01 USDC). This fee is directed to the developers who trained and deployed the assistant, incentivizing useful and high-quality AI tools.

### 4. x402 + CDP Wallet Integration
All transactions—whether bounty funding, solution submission, or AI queries—are handled via the **x402 protocol** and **CDP Wallet APIs**. This ensures seamless, secure, and permissionless interactions between users without manual wallet management.
